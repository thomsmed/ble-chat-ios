# BLE Chat

A BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) and [Core Bluetooth](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corebluetooth) showcasing app.

## About

This repository serves as an example on how to work with Apple's [Core Bluetooth Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corebluetooth).
It contains an example local chat application, which uses Core Bluetooth and BLE as the medium of communication.
The application is also a SwiftUI rewrite of the [BLEChat](https://github.com/thomsmed/ios-examples/tree/main/BLEChat) example app over at https://github.com/thomsmed/ios-examples. Check out that one if you prefer using UIKit.
